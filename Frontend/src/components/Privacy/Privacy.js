        <h2>4. Payment</h2>
        <p>
          We use Razorpay for processing payments. We/Razorpay do not store your
          card data on their servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment
          Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing
          payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is
          necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is
          complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed
          by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of
          brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
        </p>
        <p>
          PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card
          information by our store and its service providers.
